Teesside Leage Basketball web site
==================================

I worked on this site between 2009 and 2013 ish until the league sadly folded. Is it the best code ever? Nope, it's really not. Did I learn a lot and was it useful players in the Teesside Basketball League, absolutely. I used this is a testing ground for lots of .NET MVC stuff and [bloged about how it evolved](http://www.philjhale.com/2011/10/teesside-basketball-league.html) over the years.
