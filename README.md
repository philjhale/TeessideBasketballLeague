Teesside Leage Basketball web site
==================================

I worked on this site between 2009 and 2013 ish until the league sadly folded. Is it the best code ever? Nope, this was a project I started to learn about .NET MVC. Was it useful to people involved in the Teesside Basketball League, yes. Did I learn a lot, absolutely. I used this is a testing ground for various things I wanted to experiment with. I've [bloged about how it evolved](http://www.philjhale.com/2011/10/teesside-basketball-league.html) over the years.
